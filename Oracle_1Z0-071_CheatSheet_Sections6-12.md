## 6. Reporting Aggregated Data Using Group Functions

COUNT(*)      - Total number of rows  
COUNT(col)    - Non-null values only  
SUM(col)      - Total of numeric values  
AVG(col)      - Average of values  
MIN(col)      - Minimum value  
MAX(col)      - Maximum value  

**GROUP BY Example:**
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

**HAVING Clause:**
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

## 7. Displaying Data from Multiple Tables Using Joins

**INNER JOIN**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**OUTER JOIN**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

**USING Clause**
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d USING (department_id);
```

**SELF JOIN**
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name, e2.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;
```

## 8. Using Subqueries to Solve Queries

**Single-Row Subquery**
```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

**Multi-Row Subquery**
```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
  SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1700
);
```

**Correlated Subquery**
```sql
SELECT e1.first_name
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary)
  FROM employees e2
  WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id
);
```

**EXISTS**
```sql
SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
```

## 9. Using SET Operators

**UNION** - Combines results, removes duplicates  
**UNION ALL** - Combines all, keeps duplicates  
**INTERSECT** - Rows common to both queries  
**MINUS** - Rows in first but not in second  

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT employee_id FROM employees
UNION
SELECT employee_id FROM job_history;
```

## 10. Manipulating Data

**INSERT**
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name) VALUES (300, 'John');
```

**UPDATE**
```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE department_id = 50;
```

**DELETE**
```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 300;
```

**Transaction Control**

| Command   | Description               |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| COMMIT    | Save changes permanently  |
| ROLLBACK  | Undo changes              |
| SAVEPOINT | Create a rollback point  |

```sql
SAVEPOINT sp1;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
```

## 11. Using DDL Statements to Create and Manage Tables

**CREATE TABLE**
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  dept_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL
);
```

**ALTER TABLE**
```sql
ALTER TABLE departments ADD (location_id NUMBER);
ALTER TABLE departments MODIFY (name VARCHAR2(100));
ALTER TABLE departments DROP COLUMN location_id;
```

**DROP TABLE**
```sql
DROP TABLE departments;
```

**Constraints:**

| Constraint   | Description                  |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| PRIMARY KEY  | Unique, not null identifier  |
| FOREIGN KEY  | Enforces referential integrity |
| NOT NULL     | Column must have a value     |
| UNIQUE       | No duplicate values          |
| CHECK        | Enforces value condition     |

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT emp_dept_fk
FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id);
```

## 12. Creating Other Schema Objects

**VIEW**
```sql
CREATE VIEW emp_view AS
SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees;
```

**SEQUENCE**
```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE emp_seq START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 1;
```

**INDEX**
```sql
CREATE INDEX emp_name_idx ON employees (last_name);
```

**SYNONYM**
```sql
CREATE SYNONYM emp FOR employees;
```
